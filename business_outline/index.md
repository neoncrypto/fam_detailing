### 💡 **ROI Insights**

- **Ceramic Coating = Maximum Efficiency** – This service recovers the investment *fastest*, requiring the **fewest jobs**. If time is a constraint, this is the top choice for profitability.  

- **High-Volume Services Require Strategy** – Express Full Service, Interior, and Exterior Detailing need **significantly more** jobs to reach break-even. These should be leveraged as entry-level services to drive **upsells** into more profitable offerings.  

- **Larger Vehicles = Faster ROI** – Trucks and XL SUVs generate revenue *faster* than cars and small SUVs. With higher price points, they require fewer services to recover costs. **Targeting larger vehicles maximizes efficiency.**  

- **Discounting = Double the Work** – While discounting attracts customers, it also **nearly doubles** the services needed to break even. **Strategic discounting** is necessary to prevent revenue loss.  

- **Full Detail: The Sweet Spot** – Sitting between basic services and high-end coatings, Full Detail offers a **strong profit margin** while still requiring a manageable number of jobs. It should be positioned as the **default recommendation** for most customers.  

- **Winning Strategy for ROI**:  
  1. **Use Express & Basic Services** to attract new customers.  
  2. **Push Full Detail as the go-to package** for steady revenue.  
  3. **Upsell Ceramic Coating** for high-ticket sales with fewer jobs.  
  4. **Prioritize larger vehicles** to maximize earnings per job.  

- **Ceramic Coating requires the fewest jobs** to recover the investment.  
- **Interior & Exterior services require the most jobs**, especially for smaller vehicles.  
- **Trucks generate revenue faster per job**, requiring fewer services than cars/SUVs.
