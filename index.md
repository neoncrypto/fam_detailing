### üìä The ROI Data

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tM28tmwH/roi-chart.png" alt="ROI Chart" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;">

To recover the initial investment of **$1257.20**, Sparkle Co. would need to perform approximately the following number of services:

| Service           | Car  | SUV  | Truck |
|------------------|------|------|------|
| Full            | 5.03  | 4.19  | 3.59  |
| Interior        | 8.38  | 6.29  | 5.03  |
| Exterior        | 8.38  | 6.29  | 5.03  |
| Ceramic Coating | 2.51  | 2.10  | 1.80  |

\*estimates assume the full amount charged for each service will be used to recover the initial investment.

<a id="key-roi-insights"></a>
### üí° Key ROI Insights

- **Ceramic Coating** requires the fewest jobs to recover the investment.
- **Interior & Exterior services** require the most jobs, especially for smaller vehicles.
