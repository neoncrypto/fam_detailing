## 👪 Family Owned & Operated

Sparkle Co. is a family-run car wash and detailing service looking to kick start and launch in April 2025. We want to build a business and more importantly we want to teach the children about the value of hard work, the economy, customer service, and managing a business. But in order to get this venture off the ground, we need your support!

To help kick start our company we are temporarily offering our first clients <a href="#family-friends-service-pricing" title="Family and Friends Pricing">gigantic discounts</a> in exchange for an [honest review!](https://form.jotform.com/250898871937175)

Revenue raised through offering these discounts will <a href="#roadmap" title="Sparkle Co. Roadmap">go towards</a> supplies, building our reputation and launching our official website.

Your support means everything to our success!
